Hello,


This application contains the Belgian Interim Guide for COVID-19 treatment as of 4th April 2020. Providing the app to a health provider may be of benefit during COVID-19. The program can be run with the covid19.exe application.

The app may restart due to the security on your PC and the program is compatible to Windows 10. Follow the instructions on the screen and read through all the output guidelines.

Please be careful to only use the information with caution if any to your own protocol. If you could contribute a protocol, kindly send a request.


Best wishes,
