17th June Update: Dexamethasone is not a proven medication for COVID-19. The medication is anti-inflammatory, causes immune suppression and serious bacterial infections, therefore, routine usage of antibiotics are within the treatment guidelines of the dexamethasone RECOVERY trials in the UK. The British death rate is above 10 times the global average, therefore the claim of 30% reduction in fatality of critically ill patients without proof is bullshit and of no substantial improvement for other countries. The has been the first increase in global deaths since early May after the heavy promotion of dexamethasone.
